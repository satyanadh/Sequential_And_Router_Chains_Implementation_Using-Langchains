        "3. **Tricky Language**: Sometimes people write reviews with jokes or hidden meanings, and it's hard to tell if they're happy or not. It's a fun challenge to build something that gets the real meaning.\n",

        "4. **Helps Businesses React Fast**: When businesses know what customers are saying right away, they can fix problems quicker or do more of what people love.\n",
